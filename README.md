# palette
This is going to be a color palette application. I am going to start by building Colt Steele's Massive Color Project in hooks, he uses class components. Once it is finished and working as it should; I will be re-building it out with the gained knowledge and customizing it into a modern and sleek color palette website with added depth and funcitonality.

## technologies
This project utilizes react hooks, yarn, CSS, and JavaScript (ES6)
